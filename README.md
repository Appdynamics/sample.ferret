Ferret
======

This sample project contains a simple Servlet application called Ferret. Ferret listens for HTTP requests sent to `<host>:<port>/ferret[/*]`, and responds with information about the request and the server.

## Running in Eclipse

1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server. See [step 3](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/) for details.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the *ferret* sample and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*. 
6. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/ferret](http://localhost:9080/ferret)

## Running with Maven

This project can be build with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven) to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [WASdev repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. To activate the automatic download and installation of Liberty runtime, you will first need to obtain the Liberty license code. To obtain this code read the current [Liberty license](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/8.5.5.2/lafiles/runtime//en.html) and look for the `D/N: <license code>` line. Set the `IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE` environment property with the license code found in the Liberty license file:
    ```bash
    $ export IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE=<license code>
    ```

2. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

3. To run the server with the Ferret sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret](http://localhost:9080/ferret).
